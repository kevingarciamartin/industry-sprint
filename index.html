            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>If you're starting out as a front-end developer, getting comfortable with HTML and CSS is a must. These are your bread and butter for building and styling websites. HTML gives structure to your page, and CSS makes it look good. Without these basics, creating responsive and attractive sites would be pretty tough!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="javascript">
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is where the fun begins! It‚Äôs what makes websites come alive with things like animations, buttons that actually do something, and real-time updates. Once you‚Äôre comfortable with JavaScript, you can level up by learning React. React makes it super easy to build fast, interactive sites by letting you reuse pieces of code (called components), which saves time and keeps everything organized. It‚Äôs a game changer for any front-end developer.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="github">
            <h3>Github</h3>
            <p>GitHub is your best friend when it comes to keeping your code organized and working with others. It‚Äôs a tool that lets you track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage your projects smoothly. If you‚Äôre planning to work on any team, GitHub is a must-learn.</p>

            <h3>Time management</h3>
            <p>Time management is about organizing your time efficiently to prioritize important tasks. By setting clear goals and creating a schedule, you can break big tasks into smaller, manageable ones. Focus on one task at a time, avoid multitasking, and take regular breaks to stay productive. Delegating tasks when possible and regularly reviewing your progress helps you stay on track and meet deadlines effectively.</p>

          <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
          <p>
            If you're starting out as a front-end developer, getting comfortable
            with HTML and CSS is a must. These are your bread and butter for
            building and styling websites. HTML gives structure to your page,
            and CSS makes it look good. Without these basics, creating
            responsive and attractive sites would be pretty tough!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li id="javascript">
          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is where the fun begins! It’s what makes websites come
            alive with things like animations, buttons that actually do
            something, and real-time updates. Once you’re comfortable with
            JavaScript, you can level up by learning React. React makes it super
            easy to build fast, interactive sites by letting you reuse pieces of
            code (called components), which saves time and keeps everything
            organized. It’s a game changer for any front-end developer

        <li id="github">
          <h3>Github</h3>
          <p>
            GitHub is your best friend when it comes to keeping your code
            organized and working with others. It’s a tool that lets you track
            changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage your projects
            smoothly. If you’re planning to work on any team, GitHub is a
            must-learn.

          <h3>Teamwork</h3>
          <p>
            Teamwork and collaboration involve working effectively with others
            to achieve common goals. Successful teamwork requires good
            communication, trust, and mutual respect among team members.
            Collaboration means actively sharing ideas, listening to others, and
            combining strengths to solve problems or complete tasks. It also
            includes being adaptable, open to feedback, and willing to
            compromise for the success of the group. Effective collaboration
            helps achieve better results through collective effort and diverse
            perspectives.

          <h3>Networking</h3>
          <p>
            Networking and relationship building involve creating and
            maintaining professional connections that can offer support,
            opportunities, and knowledge sharing. Effective networking is about
            engaging with others, whether in person or online, to build mutually
            beneficial relationships. It requires good communication,
            authenticity, and follow-through. Building strong relationships
            helps in career growth, opens up opportunities for collaboration,
            and fosters a support system within an industry or field.

          <h3>Time Management</h3>
          <p>
            Time management is about organizing your time efficiently to
            prioritize important tasks. By setting clear goals and creating a
            schedule, you can break big tasks into smaller, manageable ones.
            Focus on one task at a time, avoid multitasking, and take regular
            breaks to stay productive. Delegating tasks when possible and
            regularly reviewing your progress helps you stay on track and meet
            deadlines effectively.

          <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>
            Problem-solving involves identifying an issue, analyzing its causes,
            and finding effective solutions. It requires critical thinking to
            break the problem into smaller parts and evaluate potential
            solutions. Creativity often helps in exploring alternative
            approaches. Once a solution is chosen, implementing it
            systematically and monitoring its effectiveness is key. Good
            problem-solving also includes learning from past challenges and
            applying those insights to future situations.
